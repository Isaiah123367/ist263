     <p>Hello, my name is Isaiah Patterson. I am currently majoring in Information Management and Technology. Some things that interest me about my major are the ability to further understand technology and to learn how to hack and defend software. My accomplishments include getting a scholarship from Rapid Response Monitoring, securing an internship with them straight out of high school, learning JavaScript in the 6th grade, coding my first software in the 7th grade, running at Newbalance nationals for track and field, owning my business at 16, and sending money to my family in Panama. Outside of school, I like to work out, watch Snowfall, and spend time with my family & friends.</p>
