    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Isaiah Patterson. I am currently a sophomore at Syracuse University and a founder of this scholarship. My goal is to reward young African Americans who are community leaders because these are the people who are going to lead our people to success. I have made my own mentorship program and believe that people who want to follow in similar steps or people who have helped people in other ways should be recognized.
