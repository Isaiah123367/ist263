        <p>Hello, my name is Isaiah Patterson. I am currently majoring in Information Management and technology. Something that interests me about my major is having the ability to further understand the technology and being able to learn how to hack and defend software. My accomplishments right now consist of getting a scholarship from Rapid Response Monitoring and securing an internship with them straight out of high school. Another accomplishment would be learning JavaScript in the 6th grade and being able to code my first ever software in the 7th grade. A list of my accomplishments includes having the opportunity to run at Newbalance nationals for track and field, owning my own business at the age of 16, and being able to send money to my family back home in Panama. Outside of school, I like to work out, watch Snowfall, and spend time with my family & friends.</p>
